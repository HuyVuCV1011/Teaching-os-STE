# Confidence Policy Logic

This document describes the public Phase 1 confidence policy logic for RubriCore-STE. It focuses on how grading orchestration interprets confidence, validates confidence-related signals, and routes candidate results to finalization or teacher review.

Grading execution is described in [Grading Orchestration Logic](05-grading-orchestration.md). Submitted answer package immutability is described in [Answer Lifecycle](04-answer-lifecycle.md). Rubric scoring boundaries are described in [Rubric Framework Logic](03-rubric-framework.md).

## Core Boundary

Confidence is an auditable policy summary of whether a candidate grading result is valid, complete, evidence-supported, and eligible for the requested routing action.

It is not:

- a replacement for deterministic validation
- a model-only trust score
- a teacher override
- a reason to hide ambiguity
- a reason to finalize incomplete rubric coverage

The final routing decision is separate from the raw confidence value. High confidence can still route to review when a policy gate applies.

## Implemented Service Shape

The current backend slice implements confidence policy inside `app.db.services.grading_orchestration`.

The implemented policy uses:

- `GradingPolicy.confidence_threshold`
- `GradingPolicy.review_threshold`
- `GradingPolicy.auto_finalize_allowed`
- `GradingPolicy.mandatory_review`
- deterministic scoring confidence
- validated AI aggregate confidence
- rubric coverage checks
- AI validation status
- deterministic/AI disagreement checks

The default Phase 1 thresholds are:

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `confidence_threshold` | `0.85` |
| `review_threshold` | `0.70` |

## Confidence Bands

| Band | Rule | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `high` | confidence is at or above `confidence_threshold` | eligible for auto-finalization only if all gates pass |
| `medium` | confidence is at or above `review_threshold` but below `confidence_threshold` | plausible but review-routed by default |
| `low` | confidence is above `0` but below `review_threshold` | uncertain and review-routed |
| `blocked` | confidence is missing, zero, or blocked by validation | no safe automated finalization |

The implementation uses configured policy thresholds when assigning bands. Thresholds should not be treated as universal constants.

## Allowed Confidence Inputs

The policy can use:

- deterministic score confidence
- validated AI aggregate confidence
- valid AI criterion confidence
- rubric criterion coverage
- evidence references to submitted evidence
- structured AI validation status
- deterministic/AI score agreement
- mandatory review policy
- auto-finalization policy

The policy should not use hidden provider heuristics, unrelated learner data, prompt length, latency, or unvalidated AI prose as confidence signals.

## Routing Rules

A result may auto-finalize only when:

- the submitted package and grading context are valid
- deterministic checks completed
- AI output is valid when AI is required or used for scoring
- all required rubric criteria are covered by deterministic or valid AI results
- AI criterion suggestions include evidence references to submitted evidence when AI contributes scoring
- scores are within rubric bounds
- confidence is in the `high` band
- no deterministic/AI disagreement exists
- mandatory review is not enabled
- auto-finalization is allowed

The service creates a `ReviewTask` when:

- confidence is below the auto-finalization threshold
- confidence is missing
- rubric coverage is incomplete
- AI output fails validation
- AI is required but no valid AI payload exists
- deterministic and AI scoring disagree
- deterministic warnings are present
- mandatory review is enabled
- auto-finalization is disabled

Review tasks preserve confidence band, escalation reason, policy payload, grading run ID, grading result ID, and submission context.

## Persistence

`GradingResult.explanation_payload` stores:

- confidence summary
- source confidence values
- confidence band
- policy thresholds
- AI validation summary
- rubric coverage summary
- disagreement flags
- routing decision and reason codes

`ReviewTask.policy_payload` stores reviewer-facing routing context:

- decision
- confidence and band
- reason codes
- policy version
- thresholds
- review priority
- coverage summary
- AI validation summary
- disagreement flags

This keeps confidence explainable without requiring reviewers or auditors to reconstruct decisions from raw provider output.

Invalid optional AI output is still recorded and audited. It does not block finalization when deterministic scoring is complete and all non-AI confidence gates pass.

## Current Verification

Run confidence-related grading tests:

```sh
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_grading_orchestration.py
```

Run the full suite:

```sh
.venv/bin/pytest
```

The current tests cover high-confidence auto-finalization, low-confidence review routing, AI-only full-coverage finalization, mandatory review overriding high confidence, incomplete rubric coverage overriding high confidence, invalid AI output routing, deterministic/AI disagreement routing, evidence-reference validation, optional invalid AI with complete deterministic scoring, medium-confidence review routing, and deterministic warning routing.

## Phase 1 Limits

This slice intentionally defers:

- calibrated statistical confidence models
- adaptive threshold learning
- multi-model voting
- provider-specific confidence normalization
- reviewer sampling programs
- advanced score-boundary policies
- subject-specific confidence formulas
- automated AI retry budgeting

Phase 1 favors a small, explicit gate-based confidence policy over hidden scoring formulas.
